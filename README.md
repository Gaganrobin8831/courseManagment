## Swagger Testing
This project includes a swagger.yaml file that defines the API endpoints, request parameters, and responses in a standardized OpenAPI format. You can use this file to test and document the API.

Using the **swagger.yaml** File
## Use an Online Swagger Editor:

Visit the Swagger Editor.
Copy the contents of the **swagger.yaml** file from your project.
Paste the contents into the editor.
The Swagger Editor will display the API documentation, allowing you to interact with and test the API endpoints directly from the browser.

### Postman Collection for API Testing
To make API testing easier, a Postman collection is provided for this project. This collection includes all the necessary endpoints and can be used to quickly test the API without manually configuring each request.

### Importing the Postman Collection
Follow these steps to import the Postman collection:

**1. Download the Postman Collection:**

The Postman collection file (CourseManagment.postman_collection.json) is included in the repository.

**2. Import the Collection into Postman:**

Open Postman.
Click on the "Import" button in the top left corner.
Select the CourseManagment.postman_collection.json file from your local machine.
Click "Open" to import the collection.

**3. Start Testing:**

Once the collection is imported, you can start making requests to the API endpoints defined in the collection. Each request includes predefined settings for method, URL, headers, and body, making it easier to test the API.
